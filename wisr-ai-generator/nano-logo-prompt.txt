PROMPT FOR NANO - LendWise Mortgage Logo Generation
=====================================================

Please create a logo for "LendWise Mortgage" with these EXACT specifications:

LOGO ELEMENTS:
--------------
1. Gold owl with green eyes (same style you created previously)
   - Owl should be SMALL - approximately 25-30% the height of the full logo
   - Gold metallic gradient with shading
   - Bright green glowing eyes

2. Text "LENDWISE MORTGAGE" in metallic gold:
   - "LENDWISE" - larger text, top line
   - "MORTGAGE" - smaller text, bottom line
   - Letters "L" and "W" should be slightly larger (10-15% bigger) than other letters
   - Metallic gold gradient effect (shiny, reflective appearance)
   - Clean, crisp edges

LAYOUT:
-------
- Owl positioned on the LEFT side
- Text positioned on the RIGHT side
- Owl should be vertically CENTERED relative to the text
- Minimal spacing between owl and text (about 15-20 pixels)
- Compact, professional layout

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------
✓ TRANSPARENT BACKGROUND - absolutely no white, gray, or colored background
✓ High quality PNG with alpha transparency channel
✓ Sharp, clean edges on all elements
✓ No pixelation or artifacts
✓ Owl must be SMALL relative to text (not the same height)

DIMENSIONS:
-----------
- Recommended width: 500-700px
- Recommended height: 150-200px
- Owl height should be roughly the same as the word "LENDWISE" alone (not full logo)

STYLE REFERENCE:
----------------
Use the same metallic gold, green-eyed owl you created before, but make it much smaller.
The owl should complement the text, not dominate it.
Think: professional business logo for stationery, websites, business cards.

Format: PNG with alpha transparency
Quality: High resolution, print-ready
