## Key Insight

**The "15-word rule" was MISUNDERSTOOD.**

It's not about writing 15-word continuous sentences. It's about keeping EACH PHRASE to 15 words maximum, using SHORT DESCRIPTIVE LABELS and BULLET POINTS.

**Tonight's successful manual tests used:**
- "Current 30-year rate" (3 words)
- "Key economic factors like Fed policy and inflation" (8 words)
- "Contact David Young NMLS 62043 Phone 310-954-7771" (7 words)

**NOT continuous flowing prose!**

## Deployment Status

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY

**Confidence Level:** HIGH with shadow method

**Recommended Action:** Update all production templates to use shadow separation method for maximum reliability

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply shadow method to all templates
2. Convert any long sentences to short phrases
3. Test each template once
4. Deploy with confidence
